# CodeSnippets-For-C#
My CodeSnippets For Easy Programming On C#

## Installation

Download the .snippet files and paste them in that directory.

D:\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets

## Testing
After that start Visual Studio and write something like that:
 
printmatrix

After that press TAB two times and love the magic :)

## Make Your Own Snippet Shortcut
Also you can open every .snippet file in Notpad and see the tag

```C#
Edit Snippet Shortcut

<Shortcut>Your Name Here</Shortcut?
```

## Save And Test 

There you can write your own shortcut.
When you do that you should save the file and go back to Visual Studio and try to type your new shortcut and press the TAB button two times.
