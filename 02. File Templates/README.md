My File Templates For Easy Creating New Classes And Inrefaces On C#

## Installation

Download the .cs files and paste them in that directory. There you will find two folders - Class and Interface. You should replace the files.

## Testing

Love the magic :)

## Make Your Own Access Modifier
Also you can open every .cs file in Notpad and the access modifier - public. You can change it by your own.

```C#
Edit Access Modifier

YourModifierHere class $safeitemrootname$
```

There you can write your own access modifier.

## Save And Test 

When you save the file, go back to Visual Studio and try to create new Class or Interface.
